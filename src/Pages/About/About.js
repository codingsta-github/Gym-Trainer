            <p>
                I'm Sheikh Tofayel Ahmed. 
                I always wanted to be a programmer. 
                There was few reasons. 
                That's why I couldn't. 
                But I never forget about my passion. 
                So, I started learning web development from the beginning of 2021. 
                For my teaching job I hadn't enough time to practice. 
                Then I decided to join here and few days ago I left the job only for being a web developer. 
                I'm fully determined to be a fullstack developer. 
                Daily I'm learning something through the course.
                I'll never stop learning .
